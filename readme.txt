readme file .

I feel like I have a good grasp on knockout JS and googlemaps
the problem that i am having is putting them together . 
I still dont feel that i sm an expert by any means in either of them and 
just need to see if there is something simple i am missing . 
I looked at other peoples examples and it seems that they have a lot of functions 
and passing alot of variables ... I dont feel that I am comfortable with passing 
variables all over the place .and the syntax is really confusing to me .

the mixed2 folder is the most recent
